![Hi friends, It's Alex Olsavsky!](https://tinytriumphs-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/hi-friends-banner.gif)

I'm a front-end developer with roots as a nonprofit leader and professional singer. I currently work for Chicago design agency, <a href=https://studiopax.io/>Studio Pax</a>. We work primarily in Craft CMS through the LAMP stack.

Check out my <a href="https://ajolsavsky.github.io/react-portfolio/">portfolio</a> to learn about my journey and view my projects!
